# Cameras, AI, and Food Delivery

Regardless of whether you've used food delivery services like Doordash and Uber Eats, their convenience is undeniable. And when you're an international student living on campus, they're often the only option when you want non-cafeteria food.

At my highschool, boarding students used these apps all the time. But they'd still have to walk all the way to the front gate to pick up their food (a surprisingly long journey). So my friend and I decided to build a robot that would deliver food from the front gate to the dorms.

My friend (an electrical engineering major) had very little desire to do anything beyond the hardware. So my main contribution to the project was a human detection system that would allow the robot to avoid obstacles and people. This was my first time working with AI, and I learned a lot about the process of training and deploying models.
