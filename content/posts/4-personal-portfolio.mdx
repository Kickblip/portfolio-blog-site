# Why I created this site

I love my first portfolio site - I think it's one of the coolest sites I've ever made. But it's not very practical. It's a bit hard to read and doesn't give me much room to include additional information/pictures about my projects.

![old site](/images/portfolio/old-site.gif)

I wanted to create a new portfolio that was more like a blog site, with articles and images. This was also around the time that I was getting more experience with TypeScript, NextJS, and TailwindCSS, so I wanted to use those technologies to make a "state of the art" portfolio site.

# My goals for this site

The main thing I wanted was more space to write about my projects. My old site was just a collection of links to my projects github repos, it didn't have any information beyond the title and didn't have any space to link to live demos.
I also wanted space for thumbnail images on my new site, so I could give the user a preview of each of my projects without them having the read the attached article.

These examples were some of my main inspirations for my new site:

<div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 grid-cols-1 gap-2">
    <div className="sm:h-48 h-64">![Image 1](/images/portfolio/chirpy.png)</div>
    <div className="sm:h-48 h-64">![Image 2](/images/portfolio/nobellium.png)</div>
    <div className="sm:h-48 h-64">![Image 3](/images/portfolio/taxonomy.png)</div>
    <div className="sm:h-48 h-64">![Image 4](/images/portfolio/snakebyte.png)</div>
</div>

I wanted the articles layouts of the top two sites, and I wanted the thumbnail images and tagging of the bottom two sites.

Minimalism was the name of the game for this site. And I wanted to use the latest and greatest technologies to make it.

# How I built it

### Home Page

I knew from looking at other tech blog projects that I would write my articles in markdown then use some kind of markdown parser to conver the files into HTML. I had the option of using a static site generator (SSG) like Gatsy or Jekyll, but I had previously decided on using NextJS for my site. This also meant that I could use <a href="https://www.contentlayer.dev/" target="_blank">ContentLayer</a> as my markdown cms/parser since it plugs in easily with NextJS.
On the NextJS website I found a template blog that used ContentLayer, so I used that as a starting point for my site.

It needed some work, but it was an excellent starting point and let me focus on the design of my site instead of the markdown parsing. I made a lot of changes to the template, but the main ones on the homepage were:

1. Widening the content of the pages and using the new space to add thumbnail images to the articles.

2. Changing the home button to an icon on the navbar and adding a short introduction below the title of the page.

3. Adding a tagging system to the articles so you can see what technologies I'm using at a glance.

The information for each of these articles is stored in the header of their respective MDX file.

### Project Page

For the actual project pages, I needed to incorporate two links into every project - the github repo and the live demo.

![templatearticle](/images/portfolio/templatearticle.png)

The template didn't have anything like this, so I made a new component that would take in the github and live links as props and display them as buttons. I wanted this component to float down the page as the user scrolled and I decided putting it on the right would look cool.
So I made the width of the text content less than the home page and moved it to the left of the screen, leaving room for my new component on the right.

![myversionarticle](/images/portfolio/myversionarticle.gif)

Of course, some of my projects are closed source or they don't have a live demo (or both), so I made the header arguments optional in my articles.
This means that if the component doesn't provide a link to a repo or demo, the button becomes a disabled grey color and doesn't link anywhere.

<div className="flex">
    <div className="w-1/2">![buttons1](/images/portfolio/buttons1.png)</div>
    <div className="w-1/2">![buttons2](/images/portfolio/buttons2.png)</div>
</div>
