# Background

I built the vast majority of this project in a bored afternoon at school. I was originally inspired by a video of an ascii donut spinning
around. The concept was strangely fascinating for me - I loved the retro and minimalistic look of the final product, so I knew I wanted to
make spinning ascii shapes.

I was also wanting to try out ThreeJS, a JavaScript library designed to create and display 3D graphics on the web. Using ThreeJS meant that
I didn't have to do as much math on the perspective/rendering side of the project, and I could instead focus on creating the polyhedra
geometries.

# Calculating Polyhedra

The first step in creating the polyhedra was to calculate the vertices and faces of each shape. This data can be found in a [collection of polyhedra models](http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/vp.html)
made by George Hart. The data is stored in objects:

```javascript
const POLYHEDRA = {
    Tetrahedron: {
        name: "Tetrahedron",
        category: ["Platonic Solid"],
        vertex: [
            [0, 0, 1.732051],
            [1.632993, 0, -0.5773503],
            [-0.8164966, 1.414214, -0.5773503],
            [-0.8164966, -1.414214, -0.5773503],
        ],
        edge: [
            [0, 1],
            [0, 2],
            [0, 3],
            [1, 2],
            [1, 3],
            [2, 3],
        ],
        face: [
            [0, 1, 2],
            [0, 2, 3],
            [0, 3, 1],
            [1, 3, 2],
        ],
    },
    /* ... */
}
```

Each polyhedron has a name, category, vertices, edges, and faces. The vertices are stored as an array of arrays, where each sub-array is the coordinates of a vertex.
The edges are stored as an array of arrays, where each sub-array is the indices of the vertices that make up the edge. The faces are stored as an array of arrays,
where each sub-array is the indices of the vertices that make up the face. For this project, I'm really only using the vertices and faces because ThreeJS only needs to
construct the faces of the polyhedron.

# Ascii Filter

I originally wanted to do ascii rendering directly on the polyhedron geometry, but this method was somewhat incompatible with ThreeJS.
Instead, I decided to use a filter to render the ascii version of the polyhedron. The filter adds a DOM element on top of the canvas that holds text characters.
The ascii characters inside this big element are chosen based on the luminosity (brightness) of the pixels underneath.

<div className="flex">
    <div className="w-1/2">![before](/images/polyhedra/before.png)</div>
    <div className="w-1/2">![after](/images/polyhedra/after.png)</div>
</div>

# Keeping it Simple

I knew I wanted to include multiple polyhedra in the project, but I also wanted to keep the UI as minimalistic as possible.
I decided on a slider at the top of the screen that lets the user scroll through the different shapes that are available.
I used this instead of a dropdown menu because most people don't really know what polyhedra are, so they wouldn't know what
to look for in a dropdown menu. The slider is also more interactive and adds a level of mystery/discovery to the project.
