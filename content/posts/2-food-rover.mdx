Making cool stuff is really cool and hopefully I'll have a chance to come back to this entry and talk more about all the cool stuff and work I put into this project. I'm not sure what else to say here so I'm just going to keep typing until I feel like I've written enough words to make this look like a decently sized paragraph.

Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.

What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.
