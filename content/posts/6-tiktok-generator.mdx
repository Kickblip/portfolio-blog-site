title: Automated TikTok Generator
description: Automatically generating reddit story TikToks that have become so popular.  The app uses the reddit API to get popular posts, puppeteer to screenshot them, AWS Polly to create a TTS voiceover, YouTube API to find background footage, and YTDL-P to download the footage.  All these components are edited together using FFmpeg

# Who would watch these?

That's the question my mom asked me when I showed her the first video I generated. Since I deleted TikTok, I don't know how
relevant this bot is anymore, but at the time of making it I was seeing a lot of the same type of video on my feed.

<iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6xPVZGumCE"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    className="my-6 w-full h-[225px] md:w-[640px] md:h-[360px]"
></iframe>

These videos are usually a screenshot of a reddit post, with a voiceover of the post being read out loud. The background is usually a video of a video game, or someone watching, or something else
that is just a little bit interesting. It's a formula that works, and I wanted to see if I could automate it.

# Getting Screenshots

## Reddit API

The first component of this project is getting screenshots of the reddit posts. Before you can start screenshotting though, you'll need to find relevant
posts to use. I used the reddit API to get the top posts on a given time frame (day/week/month) from a target subreddit.

```javascript
const response = await fetch(endpoint)
const data = await response.json()
const topPosts = data.data.children.map((post) => post.data)

const postPromises = topPosts.map(async (post) => {
    const commentsEndpoint = `https://www.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}/comments/${post.id}.json`
    const commentsResponse = await fetch(commentsEndpoint)
    const commentsData = await commentsResponse.json()
    const comments = commentsData[1].data.children.map((comment) => comment.data)
    return { post, comments }
})

const results = await Promise.all(postPromises)
```

This will give you an array of posts, each with an array of comments. Then, it's just a matter of picking a post. I chose to pick the first post every time, but you could easily randomize this.

```javascript
const targetURL = `https://www.reddit.com${results[0].post.permalink}`
const targetComment1 = `https://www.reddit.com${results[0].comments[0].permalink}`
const targetComment2 = `https://www.reddit.com${results[0].comments[1].permalink}`
const targetComment3 = `https://www.reddit.com${results[0].comments[2].permalink}`
```

## Puppeteer

Now that we have hyperlinks to the post and some relevant comments, we can start screenshotting. I used Puppeteer to do this, which is a headless browser that can be controlled with JavaScript.  
First, I remove elements that will get in the way of the screenshot, like the prompt to download the reddit app, by filtering their tag.

```javascript
const ad = document.getElementsByTagName("shreddit-comments-page-ad")
if (ad.length) {
    console.log("Removing shreddit-comments-page-ad elements")
    for (const blocker of ad) {
        blocker.remove()
    }
}
```

You can find troublesome elements by watching the Puppeteer browser in non-headless mode, and then using the dev tools to find the element's tag.

Next, I take the actual screenshot by looking for a post element or comment element, and then taking a screenshot of that element.

```javascript
if (urls.indexOf(url) === 0) {
    // if the first url, take a screenshot of the post
    const target = document.getElementsByTagName("shreddit-post")[0].getBoundingClientRect()
    return {
        x: target.x || 0,
        y: target.y || 60,
        width: target.width || 375,
        height: target.height || 210,
    }
} else {
    // after the first url, take a screenshot of the comment using its body dimensions
    const body = document.getElementById("-post-rtjson-content").getBoundingClientRect()
    return {
        x: 0,
        y: 435,
        width: 375,
        height: body.height + 85 || 300,
    }
}
```

The most important part of the screenshot is to adjust the dimensions of the screenshot so they fit the content nicely. You can use the height of the post/comment DOM element itself
to ensure that the screenshot is capturing all the content. As programmers I feel that we often take pride in the smallest details that users take for granted, and this is certainly one of those details.
