# Why I created this site

I love my first portfolio site - I think it's one of the coolest sites I've ever made. But it's not very practical. It's a bit hard to read and doesn't give me much room to include additional information/pictures about my projects.

I wanted to create a new portfolio that was more like a blog site, with articles and images. This was also around the time that I was getting more experience with TypeScript, NextJS, and TailwindCSS, so I wanted to use those technologies to make a "state of the art" portfolio site.

# My goals for this site

The main thing I wanted was more space to write about my projects. My old site was just a collection of links to my projects github repos, it didn't have any information beyond the title and didn't have any space to link to live demos.
I also wanted space for thumbnail images on my new site, so I could give the user a preview of each of my projects without them having the read the attached article.

These examples were some of my main inspirations for my new site:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <div className="h-48">![Image 1](/images/portfolio/chirpy.png)</div>
    <div className="h-48">![Image 2](/images/portfolio/nobellium.png)</div>
    <div className="h-48">![Image 3](/images/portfolio/taxonomy.png)</div>
    <div className="h-48">![Image 4](/images/portfolio/snakebyte.png)</div>
</div>

I wanted the articles layouts of the top two sites, and I wanted the thumbnail images and tagging of the bottom two sites.

Minimalism was the name of the game for this site. And I wanted to use the latest and greatest technologies to make it.
